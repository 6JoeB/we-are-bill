## Game Rules

One player becomes the storyteller/dungeon master, all other players will become Bill when it is their turn.

Every player except the storyteller sends an objective to the storyteller, this is their game goal, it can be anything from buying an avocado to stealing a car. The storyteller may reject an objective and request a new one if it is deemed too easy.

Initially a name for the main character and a starting location is chosen/voted for. 

All players except for the storyteller roll a dice and whoever scores highest will start as Bill.

Now the game begins, Bill wakes up in *chosen location* and must choose an action to try and bring them closer to their goal. The storyteller and other players then vote on how hard that task is deemed (based on a D6 roll, 2+ easiest, 6+ hardest).
If the player successfully rolls the dice, their task is completed and they can continue attempting tasks.
If the player fails the roll, Bill blacks out and the next player becomes Bill and can attempt to achieve their goal through action attempts.
